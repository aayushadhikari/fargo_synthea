       "- Medications: The patient has previously received Acetaminophen 300 mg / Hydrocodone Bitartrate 5 mg oral tablets. This is a combination opioid analgesic, which is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus (including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and possible teratogenicity).\n",
       "- Allergies: The patient has a history of moderate rhinoconjunctivitis and mild skin eruptions, suggesting possible allergic tendencies, but no specific drug allergies are documented.\n",
       "\n",
       "Clinical reasoning:\n",
       "- If the patient is still taking Acetaminophen/Hydrocodone, this medication should be reviewed and ideally discontinued or substituted with a safer alternative prior to conception.\n",

       "- No other significant medical history is documented that would directly impact pregnancy planning.\n",

       "Recommendations:\n",
       "1. Review current medication use—if the patient is still on opioid analgesics, discuss tapering and alternative pain management strategies.\n",
       "2. Consider preconception counseling, including review of immunization status, folic acid supplementation, and screening for other medical conditions not listed here.\n",
